# PandaSwap :panda_face:

PandaSwap is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) built on the BINANCE Smart Chain (BSC) network, providing users with a platform to securely swap their ERC-20 tokens. The Dex is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool of two ERC20 tokens named TokenA and TokenB. This project is developed by Abdulhakim Altunkaya for the BNB Patika Course.

## Features :star:

- Token Swapping: Users can swap any ERC-20 token pairs available on the platform.
- Add/Remove Liquidity: Users can become liquidity providers by adding liquidity to their preferred token pairs and earn transaction fees.
- Fee Charging: PandaSwap charges a small fee per transaction that is added back to the token reserves, rewarding liquidity providers.
- Minimized Slippage: A safety mechanism is in place to prevent high slippage trades.
- Balance and Reserve Checks: Users can check their token balances as well as the reserves of each token pair.
